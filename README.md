**Car Sales Multiple Regression Analysis**

**Repository Overview**

This repository contains an in-depth multiple regression analysis of car sales data conducted using Microsoft Excel. The project focuses on exploring relationships between various car attributes and their impact on selling price. The analysis uses Excel's Data Analysis Toolpak instead of manual formula-driven approaches like LINEST, prioritizing simplicity and ease of use.

**Dataset Description**

The analysis is based on a dataset of used cars, capturing detailed information about their features, specifications, and sales records. The dataset has been cleaned and processed to derive meaningful insights.

**Analysis Highlights**

1. Initial Exploration:

Examined correlations between independent variables (e.g., Age, KM Driven) and the dependent variable (Selling Price).

Filtered and visualized data to remove outliers and ensure relevance.

2. Regression Analysis:

Conducted multiple regression analysis using Excelâ€™s Data Analysis Toolpak.

Dependent Variable: Selling Price.

Independent Variables: Age, KM Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, Engine Size, Max Power.

3. Key Results:

Identified the most significant predictors of selling price.

Evaluated model performance using R-squared and residual analysis.

4. Final Regression Model:

Refined model to include only the most impactful variables, improving accuracy and interpretability.

5. Correlation Analysis:

Studied the pairwise relationships between variables to understand multicollinearity and ensure a robust regression model.
